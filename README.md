# ai-chatbot-llm
This project focuses on designing and implementing a full-stack AI chatbot using Large Language Models (LLMs). This integrates a Streamlit-based frontend with a FastAPI backend, which communicates with an LLM API to generate intelligent responses. This demonstrates real-world application of AI APIs, backend development, and frontend integration.
